			<font size="13">This is my first project! We had to create a game using Scratch. When you hit the green flag, you will then try to bounce the creature as many times as you can using the paddle. As you continue to bounce the creature, the speed increases along with your score. </font>

			<font size="13">This is my App that I made using MIT App Inventor. It is a mulitplayer tic tac toe game. You can find a partner to play with and take turns choosing spots to play. Once the game is over, it will notify who won. We used the online website MIT App inventor. We made the code and put it on the website. Once it was on the website, we scaned the qr code with an i pad. This allowed it to transfer over to the i pad and we were able to play the game on there. </font>
