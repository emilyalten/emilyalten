			<font size="13">This is my first project! We had to create a game using Scratch. When you hit the green flag, you will then try to bounce the creature as many times as you can using the paddle. As you continue to bounce the creature, the speed increases along with your score. </font>

			<font size="13">This is my App that I made using MIT App Inventor. It is a mulitplayer tic tac toe game. You can find a partner to play with and take turns choosing spots to play. Once the game is over, it will notify who won. We used the online website MIT App inventor. We made the code and put it on the website. Once it was on the website, we scaned the qr code with an i pad. This allowed it to transfer over to the I pad and we were able to play the game on there. </font>

			<font size="13">This is my python project! I used the program Canopy to create my code then I used repl.it to upload it onto my website. My story is about 2 girls that go to the beach together. It is a yes or no story and depending on what you answer it will change the storyline. It took me about one day to create my code, and one more day to fix any mistakes. Some of the mistakes I had was when I wanted to end my story after a certain answer, it would not end. I asked one of my classmates as to how to fix this problem and was able to fix the issue.  </font>
